        <p id="poem">
        <br>Today is white</br>
        <br>It is not as blue as yesterday</br>
        <br>I don't know if tomorrow will be grey</br>
        <br>There was a noise from the beacon</br>
        <br>A group of crows arrived</br>
        <br>They made me <em>envy</em></br>
        <br>Since antiquity</br>
        <br>People regard crows as ominous</br>
        <br>But they are still free</br>
        <br>For them</br>
        <br>The only thing they can do is living</br>
        <br>Having a nest is enough</br>
        <br>Why do they live so comfortable</br>
        <br>I asked myself again:</br>
        <br>Are you really <em>jealous</em>?</br>
        <br>No,I'm not</br>
        <br>Humans are adventurous animals</br>
        <br>Living comfortably is not what human seek</br>
        <br><strong>You must have to work hard</strong></br>
        <br>You can be truly free</br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 class = "intro">Here's a cannonball for you</h2>
        <p>The beginning of writing this short story is the germination of Liu Yu's book---<em>send you a bullet</em>.This book recorded little things of her life for 2005-2009.And I like her book very much.</p>
